Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Browser

This was my first pass at a javascript rock page scissors game. I was able to make it work in console.log eventually without issue but felt the code was clunky and bloated from a lack of understanding. Once I started to transition into creating a GUI for it, the knowledge gap really started to show. I had read all the tutorials and supplemental resources Odin provided but rushed through the "Javascript Fundementals" to give it a try. This resulted in a lot of googling, a lot of browsing other repository submisisons for inspiration, and a lot of rabbit holing on stackoverflow.


I'm archiving it to have as a reference point for later for progress in coding clarity, understanding, and nuance. I did learn a fair bit from this attempt and all of the reaching for understanding opened up a lot of potential options for the 2nd iteration of this project.
